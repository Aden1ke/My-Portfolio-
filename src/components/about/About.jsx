      'It all started when my older brother showed me the magic behind web pages. I remember watching him inspect elements on a site and tweak the colors live in the browser, that moment felt like discovering a secret superpower. From then on, I was hooked. I spent evenings teaching myself HTML and CSS, marveling at how a few lines of code could transform into interactive pages that anyone, anywhere, could see.',

    title: 'The Beginning of My Developer Journey',
    description:
      'Like many developers, I started with HTML and CSS, building static pages and experimenting with basic layouts. But everything changed when I discovered the C language. The precision of pointers, the logic behind control structures, and the thrill of watching a console program run brought a whole new depth to coding for me. That foundation became a springboard into full-stack development, where I now blend low-level systems thinking with modern web technologies to build more efficient and thoughtful applications.',

      'Today, my days are filled with contributing to open-source projects, attending hackathons, and learning new frameworks. Youâ€™ll often find me submitting pull requests on GitHub, swapping stories at tech meet-ups, or experimenting with a fresh API. Every commit is a chance to grow, and every collaboration expands my toolkitâ€”so I never stop exploring.',

      'Outside of code, I wear many hats: agriculturalist, shoemaker, and perpetual hobbyist. I love getting my hands dirty, whether thatâ€™s tending a garden, crafting a custom pair of shoes, or diving into a completely new field. All these adventures feed my creativity in software engineering, reminding me that inspiration can come from the most unexpected places.',
